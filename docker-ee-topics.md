## Docker EE topics

Some of the certification topics are related to Docker EE. You may learn the Docker CE topics first and then switch over
to Docker EE topics. This way you can concentrate on the Docker EE topics and use a Docker EE trial efficiently.

### Domain 2: Image Creation, Management, and Registry (20% of exam)
* [Sign an image in a registry](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.4/guides/user/manage-images/sign-images/)
